This is my Morse Code Translator project completed as a student with _nology.
You can type in an English word or phrase or use the buttons to input a phrase in morse code.
The project is built in HTML, CSS and Javascript using a Morse Code object to provide the data and looping through the keys and values to power to the translator.
One of the issues to overcome was how to incorporate spaces between words and letters. To solve that issue I decided to hard-code spacing into the morse code object and
included a "space" value in the object.
I used emojis to represent the dots and dashes to make sure the morse code was readable, letters are separated by a single '/' and words by a '//' to represent a space.
Keeping the styling simple and black and white fitted with the type of project but I used Georama font from google fonts to give a hint of typeface. They styling is responsive
and I thought it would be fun to include some information about morse code in the project which is visible at larger screen sizes. Thanks to Wiki for the details!
